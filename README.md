# Air-Draw
Through this paper, we introduce an interactive real-time drawing application that harnesses computer vision and OpenCV to enable users to create digital art through motion tracking. The system employs image processing techniques to track the motion of an object, recognize the marker’s color, and draw lines on the canvas accordingly. Furthermore, a user-friendly graphical interface allows users to select from a variety of colors and includes a ”CLEAR” button to reset the canvas, enhancing the drawing experience. The project capitalizes on Python programming, employing libraries like NumPy and OpenCV for image processing and GUI development. It provides an in- teractive and intuitive way for users to engage with digital art, emphasizing real-time feedback and creative freedom. By combining technology and artistic expression, this project highlights the potential for computer vision applications to transcend language barriers, making it a versatile tool for art enthusiasts and creative individuals.
